# Employee Salary Prediction using Random Forest and Pipelines

# Overview

This project focuses on predicting employee salaries using a Random Forest Regressor, leveraging scikit-learn pipelines for efficient and organized machine learning workflows. The use of pipelines streamlines the data preprocessing (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features) and model training steps, ensuring reproducibility and maintainability of the predictive model.

# Features

* **Random Forest Regression:** Utilizes the robust Random Forest algorithm for accurate salary predictions.
* **Scikit-learn Pipelines:** Implements end-to-end machine learning pipelines for data preprocessing and model training.
* **Categorical Feature Handling:** Includes steps for encoding categorical variables (e.g., One-Hot Encoding).
* **Numerical Feature Preprocessing:** Incorporates techniques like imputation and scaling for numerical features.
* **Model Evaluation:** Provides metrics to assess the performance of the predictive model.


# Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

# Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* pip (Python package installer)


# Data

Place your employee salary dataset (`employee_data.csv`) in ` directory. The dataset should ideally contain features like years of experience, education level, role, department, location and a 'salary' column as the target variable.
